            <h2 class="title"> Description </h2>
                <p>Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its 
                    large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically 
                    called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although 
                    seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. 
                    It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.</p>

            <h2 class="title"> How to pick it </h2>
                <p>Find a watermelon that is a uniform size (oval or round) either is ok. You just want to watch out for 
                    irregular bumps. You want to find the melon that is heavy for its size. This usually means it will be 
                    sweeter and will have more water content. Look for an orange creamy field spot. The darker yellow field 
                    spot usually means it was on the vine longer and is full of flavor.If the field spot is white that’s a 
                    sign that the melon is not quite ripe.</p>
